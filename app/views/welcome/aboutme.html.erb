          I am a web developer with a focus on Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.
          I graduated from Dev Bootcamp in 2015 where I learned Ruby, Rails,
          HTML/CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.  On my free time, I love
          to play with Java and Android Studio, where I have a couple of apps
          on the Google PlayStore. I have several Arduinos and Raspberry Pis
          languishing in my room while I try to find some worthwhile projects.
          I love the challenge of writing code, especially the little victories
          it provides.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not writing code I love to travel the world and learn new
          languages. I know a bit of German and I'm currently learning
          French. I look forward to the next time when I can travel to France
          and the UK.

          I studied marine biology with an emphasise on tropical
          fisheries at U.C. Santa Cruz. I love to explore California
          with my friends and family, especially my native Bay Area. I'm
          always finding new places to see and things to do.

          I'm currently searching for an entry level web developer position
